# Advent of Code 2016: Day 23
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Off to a bad start when this problem's description linked to
day 11, rather than the correct day 12.

Took quite a bit of refactoring to my day 12 machine,
actually, to get it to work. I think the result is actually
better. Still reasonably efficent: 9.7s for part 2 when run
optimized on my slow laptop. Not too long to program,
either. Yay Rust.
