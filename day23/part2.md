# Day 12: Part Two

The safe doesn't open, but it *does* make several <span
title="SUCH INCORRECT! VERY LOCK! WOW!">angry noises</span> to express
its frustration.

You're quite sure your logic is working correctly, so the only other
thing is... you check the painting again. As it turns out, colored eggs
are still eggs. Now you count `12`.

As you run the program with this new input, the prototype computer
begins to *overheat*. You wonder what's taking so long, and whether the
lack of any instruction more powerful than "add one" has anything to do
with it. Don't bunnies usually *multiply*?

Anyway, *what value* should actually be sent to the safe?

Your puzzle answer was `479008299`.
