# Day 3: Part Two

Now that you've helpfully marked up their design documents,
it occurs to you that triangles are specified in groups of
three **vertically.** Each set of three numbers in a column
specifies a triangle. Rows are unrelated.

For example, given the following specification, numbers with
the same hundreds digit would be part of the same triangle:

        101 301 501
        102 302 502
        103 303 503
        201 401 601
        202 402 602
        203 403 603

In your puzzle input, and instead reading by columns, **how
many** of the listed triangles are **possible?**

Your puzzle answer was 1921.
