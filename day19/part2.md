# Day 19: Part Two

Realizing the folly of their present-exchange rules, the Elves agree to
instead steal presents from the Elf *directly across the circle*. If two
Elves are across the circle, the one on the left (from the perspective
of the stealer) is stolen from. The other rules remain unchanged: Elves
with no presents are removed from the circle entirely, and the other
elves move in slightly to keep the circle evenly spaced.

For example, with five Elves (again numbered `1` to `5`):

-   The Elves sit in a circle; Elf `1` goes first:

          1
        5   2
         4 3

-   Elves `3` and `4` are across the circle; Elf `3`'s present is
    stolen, being the one to the left. Elf `3` leaves the circle, and
    the rest of the Elves move in:

          1           1
        5   2  -->  5   2
         4 -          4

-   Elf `2` steals from the Elf directly across the circle, Elf `5`:

          1         1 
        -   2  -->     2
          4         4 

-   Next is Elf `4` who, choosing between Elves `1` and `2`, steals from
    Elf `1`:

         -          2  
            2  -->
         4          4

-   Finally, Elf `2` steals from Elf `4`:

         2
            -->  2  
         -

So, with *five* Elves, the Elf that sits starting in position `2` gets
all the presents.

With the number of Elves given in your puzzle input, *which Elf now gets
all the presents?*

Your puzzle answer was `1424135`.
