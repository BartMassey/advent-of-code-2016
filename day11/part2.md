# Day 11: Part Two

You step into the cleanroom separating the lobby from the isolated area
and put on the hazmat suit.

Upon entering the isolated containment area, however, you notice some
extra parts on the first floor that weren't listed on the record
outside:

-   An elerium generator.
-   An elerium-compatible microchip.
-   A dilithium generator.
-   A dilithium-compatible microchip.

These work just like the other generators and microchips. You'll have to
get them up to assembly as well.

What is the *minimum number of steps* required to bring all of the
objects, including these four new ones, to the fourth floor?

Your puzzle answer was `57`.
