# Advent Of Code 2016: Tutorial Solutions in Rust
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Herein lie solutions to some of the problems of the 2016
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com). Advent of Code is
a fantastic exercise, and I thank the author and others
involved profusely for their excellent work. Thanks also to
`relsqui` for pointing me at this last year.

The solutions are in directories named `day01` through
`day25`. For each solution, I have included commented and
cleaned-up Rust code. There is a `README.md` in every
problem directory containing descriptions, comments and
usage instructions. I have also included the problem
descriptions (`part1.md` and `part2.md`) and my specific
`input.txt` for posterity.

There is also a `libaoc` directory containing a library used
by all solutions. It includes a mishmash of AoC-specific
stuff and generally-useful functionality. Please see the
`libaoc` rustdoc for the details.

There are not many tests written for this code. I regard
passing both parts of a day's problem as sufficient
validation, in general.  But more should be there.

I assume you have Rust running on a fast-ish UNIX box with a
bunch of memory (although most everything should also work
on other operating systems).  A few problems are dependent
on common extra packages from Cargo.

The goals of these solutions are to:

* Provide canonical correct solutions with reasonable
  runtimes.

* Illustrate reasonable solution strategies.

* Illustrate the use of Rust in problem-solving.

I learned a ton of Rust and a little bit of software
engineering I should already have known writing these.

There's also some engineering infrastructure in the form of
the `template` directory, the `mkday.sh` and
`process-aoc.sh` shell scripts and the `libaoc` crate.  This
sped up each day's setup considerably. At the beginning of
day 34 I would "sh mkday.sh 34". At the end of the day I
would select and copy the page source of the day 34 AoC page
and then "xclipb -out | sh ../process-aoc.sh" to get
markdown into the problem files for posterity.

To generate the full rustdoc for a day, simply run this
highly intuitive command:

        cargo rustdoc --open -- --no-defaults --passes collapse-docs \
        --passes unindent-comments --passes strip-priv-imports

See Issue
[1520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1520)
for an explanation.

These solutions deserve a much more thorough top-level
description than I have the energy to write at this point.
I will revise this file in the indefinite future.

There is more refactoring that should be done, and I am
out of time and energy. Specifically:

* The `try_pat()` function of days 21 and 22 should be
  pulled to `libaoc` and used in other parts as well.

* The assembunny interpreter of days 12, 21, 23 and 25
  should be unified and pulled into its own library.

I am a novice Rust programmer. Feedback and pull requests
are extremely welcome! Let me know what I should have done,
and I'll try to make it right.
