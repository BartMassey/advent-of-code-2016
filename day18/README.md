# Advent of Code 2016: Day 18
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Well that was refreshing! Just wrote some really
straightforward Rust that compiled without major incident
and basically worked the first time. Part 1 was
instantaneous, part 2 ran in 0.3s.

## Usage

Part 1:

        cargo run 40 <input.txt

Part 2:

        cargo run --release 400000 <input.txt
