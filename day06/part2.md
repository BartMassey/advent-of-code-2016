# Day 6: Part Two

Of course, that **would** be the message - if you hadn't agreed
to use a **modified repetition code** instead.

In this modified code, the sender instead transmits what
looks like random data, but for each character, the
character they actually want to send is **slightly less likely**
than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can
look at the letter distributions in each column and choose
the **least common** letter to reconstruct the original message.

In the above example, the least common character in the
first column is a; in the second, d, and so on. Repeating
this process for the remaining characters produces the
original message, advent.

Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new
decoding methodology, **what is the original message** that
Santa is trying to send?
