# Advent of Code 2016: Day 6
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Yet another little string-and-character bashing exercise.
Nothing too tricky. The "code" for part 2 is literally
information-theoretically impossible to make work: it won't

## Usage

* Part 1:

        cargo run 1 <input.txt

* Part 2:

        cargo run 2 <input.txt
