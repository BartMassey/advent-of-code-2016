# Day 6: Signals and Noise

Something is jamming your communications with
Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed,
and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a
simple [repetition code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code)
to get the message through.

In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've
recorded the repeating message signal (your puzzle input),
but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to
recover. **Almost.**

All you need to do is figure out which character is most
frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had
recorded the following messages:

        eedadn
        drvtee
        eandsr
        raavrd
        atevrs
        tsrnev
        sdttsa
        rasrtv
        nssdts
        ntnada
        svetve
        tesnvt
        vntsnd
        vrdear
        dvrsen
        enarar

The most common character in the first column is e; in the
second, a; in the third, s, and so on. Combining these
characters returns the error-corrected message, easter.

Given the recording in your puzzle input, **what is the
error-corrected version** of the message being sent?

Your puzzle answer was cyxeoccr.
