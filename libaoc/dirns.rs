//! Directions iterator for Advent of Code 2016 solutions.
//!
//! To use this, make a new `GridBox` to set clipping bounds,
//! then call the `neighbors()` method of the `ClipBox` to get
//! an iterator over clipped neighbors in cardinal directions.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aoc::dirns::*;
//! 
//! let clip_box = GridBox::new(3, 4);
//! let neighbors = clip_box.neighbors((2, 0))
//!                 .collect::<Vec<_>>();
//! assert_eq!(neighbors, vec![(2, 1), (1, 0)]);
//! ```
