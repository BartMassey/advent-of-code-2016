//! A\* for Advent of Code 2016 solutions.
//!
//! This is a framework for running a standard [A\*
//! search][1].  To use it, implement the `SearchState`
//! trait for your search state and call `a_star()`. The
//! global state for the problem instance is passed
//! separately, and can be whatever the problem
//! requires. (For AoC 2016, it's usually some
//! representation of a maze.) Note that the memory use here
//! is non-trivial: there is a lot of cloning of states.
//!
//! The framework includes support for state labels, so that
//! the search can report paths rather than just distances.
//! Labels currently require the `Copy` trait, which is a
//! bit restrictive, but covers some obvious use cases.
//! Paths are saved with each state rather than being
//! reconstructed at the end, which is quite expensive of
//! memory. (This doesn't matter for AoC 2016, since none of
//! the A\* problems ask for a path.)
