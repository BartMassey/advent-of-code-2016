# Advent of Code 2016: Day 13
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Given that we have an A\* search lying around from the dread
day 11 solution, this was pretty straightforward.

The answer for each part was obtained in 3ms realtime (more
or less), with 0ms user time, using the debug version of the
solution.

I ran this code with
        ./soln 1 1352 31 39
and
        ./soln 2 1352 50
rather than playing fancy games with parsing and constants.
