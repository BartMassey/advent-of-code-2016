# Advent of Code 2016: Day 13
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Part 1 can be solved via A\* search, though this is probably
overkill. Part 2 is implemented as a straight flood-fill.

The answer for each part was obtained in 3ms realtime (more
or less), with 0ms user time, using the debug version of the
solution.

## Usage

Part 1:

        cargo run 1 1352 31 39

Part 2:

        cargo run 2 1352 50
