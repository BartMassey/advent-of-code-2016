# Advent of Code 2016: Day 13
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Given that we have an A\* search lying around from the dread
day 11 solution, part 1 was pretty straightforward. The
performance in part 2 showed that Dijkstra would have been
sufficient.

The answer for each part was obtained in 3ms realtime (more
or less), with 0ms user time, using the debug version of the
solution.

## Usage

Part 1:

        ./soln 1 1352 31 39

Part 2:

        ./soln 2 1352 50
