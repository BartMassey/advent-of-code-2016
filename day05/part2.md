# Day 5: Part Two

As the door slides open, you are presented with a second
door that uses a slightly more inspired security
mechanism. Clearly unimpressed by the last version (in what
movie is the password decrypted **in order?!**), the Easter
Bunny engineers have worked out
[a better solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo&t=25]).

Instead of simply filling in the password from left to
right, the hash now also indicates the **position** within the
password to fill. You still look for hashes that begin with
five zeroes; however, now, the **sixth** character represents
the **position** (0-7), and the **seventh** character is the
character to put in that position.

A hash result of 000001f means that f is the **second**
character in the password. Use only the **first result** for
each position, and ignore invalid positions.

For example, if the Door ID is abc:

* The first interesting hash is from abc3231929, which
  produces 0000015...; so, 5 goes in position 1: `_5______`.

* In the previous method, 5017308 produced an interesting
  hash; however, it is ignored, because it specifies an
  invalid position (8).

* The second interesting hash is at index 5357525, which
  produces 000004e...; so, e goes in position 4: `_5__e___`.

You almost choke on your popcorn as the final character
falls into place, producing the password 05ace8e3.

Given the actual Door ID and this new method, **what is the
password?** Be extra proud of your solution if it uses a
cinematic "decrypting" animation.

Your puzzle answer was 437e60fc.
