# Day 15: Part Two

After getting the first capsule (it contained a star! what great
fortune!), the machine detects your success and begins to rearrange
itself.

When it's done, the discs are back in their original configuration as if
it were `time=0` again, but a new disc with `11` positions and starting
at position `0` has appeared exactly one second below the
previously-bottom disc.

With this new disc, and counting again starting from `time=0` with the
configuration in your puzzle input, what is the *first time you can
press the button* to get another capsule?

Your puzzle answer was `3208099`.
