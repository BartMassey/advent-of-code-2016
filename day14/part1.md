# Day 14: One-Time Pad

In order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this
mission, you've been using a [one-time
pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) that you
[generate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity)
using a <span
title="This also happens to be the plot of World War II.">pre-agreed
algorithm</span>. Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your one-time
pad, and so you need to generate some more.

To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the
[MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) of a pre-arranged
[salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) (your puzzle
input) and an increasing integer index (starting with `0`, and
represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should be represented as
a string of *lowercase* hexadecimal digits.

However, not all of these MD5 hashes are *keys*, and you need `64` new
keys for your one-time pad. A hash is a key *only if*:

-   It contains *three* of the same character in a row, like `777`. Only
    consider the first such triplet in a hash.
-   One of the next `1000` hashes in the stream contains that same
    character *five* times in a row, like `77777`.

Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause
those hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current
hash is a key, always resume testing for keys starting with the very
next hash.

For example, if the pre-arranged salt is `abc`:

-   The first index which produces a triple is `18`, because the MD5
    hash of `abc18` contains `...cc38887a5...`. However, index `18` does
    not count as a key for your one-time pad, because none of the next
    thousand hashes (index `19` through index `1018`) contain `88888`.
-   The next index which produces a triple is `39`; the hash of `abc39`
    contains `eee`. It is also the first key: one of the next thousand
    hashes (the one at index 816) contains `eeeee`.
-   None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at
    index `92`, is: it contains `999` and index `200` contains `99999`.
-   Eventually, index `22728` meets all of the criteria to generate the
    `64`th key.

So, using our example salt of `abc`, index `22728` produces the `64`th
key.

Given the actual salt in your puzzle input, *what index* produces your
`64`th one-time pad key?

Your puzzle input was `ngcjuoqr`.

Your puzzle answer was `18626`.
