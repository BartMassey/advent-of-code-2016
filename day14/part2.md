# Day 14: Part Two

Of course, in order to make this process [even more
secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security), you've also
implemented [key
stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching).

Key stretching forces attackers to spend more time generating hashes.
Unfortunately, it forces everyone else to spend more time, too.

To implement key stretching, whenever you generate a hash, before you
use it, you first find the MD5 hash of that hash, then the MD5 hash of
*that* hash, and so on, a total of *`2016` additional hashings*. Always
use lowercase hexadecimal representations of hashes.

For example, to find the stretched hash for index `0` and salt `abc`:

-   Find the MD5 hash of `abc0`: `577571be4de9dcce85a041ba0410f29f`.
-   Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash:
    `eec80a0c92dc8a0777c619d9bb51e910`.
-   Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash:
    `16062ce768787384c81fe17a7a60c7e3`.
-   ...repeat many times...
-   Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash:
    `a107ff634856bb300138cac6568c0f24`.

So, the stretched hash for index `0` in this situation is `a107ff...`.
In the end, you find the original hash (one use of MD5), then find the
hash-of-the-previous-hash `2016` times, for a total of `2017` uses of
MD5.

The rest of the process remains the same, but now the keys are entirely
different. Again for salt `abc`:

-   The first triple (`222`, at index `5`) has no matching `22222` in
    the next thousand hashes.
-   The second triple (`eee`, at index `10`) hash a matching `eeeee` at
    index `89`, and so it is the first key.
-   Eventually, index `22551` produces the `64`th key (triple `fff` with
    matching `fffff` at index `22859`.

Given the actual salt in your puzzle input and using `2016` extra MD5
calls of key stretching, *what index* now produces your `64`th one-time
pad key?

Your puzzle answer was `20092`.
