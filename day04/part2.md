# Day 4: Part Two

With all the decoy data out of the way, it's time to decrypt
this list and get moving.

The room names are encrypted by a state-of-the-art
[shift cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher),
which is nearly unbreakable without the right
software. However, the information kiosk designers at Easter
Bunny HQ were not expecting to deal with a master
cryptographer like yourself.

To decrypt a room name, rotate each letter forward through
the alphabet a number of times equal to the room's sector
ID. A becomes B, B becomes C, Z  becomes A, and so
on. Dashes become spaces.

For example, the real name for `qzmt-zixmtkozy-ivhz-343` is
`very encrypted name`.

**What is the sector ID** of the room where North Pole objects
are stored?

Your puzzle answer was 482.
