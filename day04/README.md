# Advent of Code 2016: Day 4

Another string-bashing exercise. Sigh. The good news is that
it was a great excuse to learn how to use Rust's standard
Regex package, which is pretty nice.

Part two is a bit weak, as it isn't clear there's any way in
advance to programmatically find the answer. I cheated and
just printed all the decryptions of valid room names and
grepped for "north".
