# Advent of Code 2016: Day 20
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Wow, this one was easy. It took me longer than it should
have, because Rust and because I'm slow. A careful unit test
helped find some bugs. About 10ms for each part, compiled
for debugging.

## Usage

Part 1:

        cargo run 1 <input.txt

Part 2:

        cargo run 2 <input.txt
