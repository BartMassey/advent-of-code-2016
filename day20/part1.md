# Day 20: Firewall Rules

You'd like to set up a small hidden computer here so you can use it to
<span
title="I'll create a GUI interface using Visual Basic... see if I can track an IP address.">
get back into the network</span> later. However, the corporate firewall
only allows communication with certain external [IP
addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing).

You've retrieved the list of blocked IPs from the firewall, but the list
seems to be messy and poorly maintained, and it's not clear which IPs
are allowed. Also, rather than being written in
[dot-decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation)
notation, they are written as plain [32-bit
integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit), which can have any
value from `0` through `4294967295`, inclusive.

For example, suppose only the values `0` through `9` were valid, and
that you retrieved the following blacklist:

    5-8
    0-2
    4-7

The blacklist specifies ranges of IPs (inclusive of both the start and
end value) that are *not* allowed. Then, the only IPs that this firewall
allows are `3` and `9`, since those are the only numbers not in any
range.

Given the list of blocked IPs you retrieved from the firewall (your
puzzle input), *what is the lowest-valued IP* that is not blocked?

Your puzzle answer was `31053880`.
