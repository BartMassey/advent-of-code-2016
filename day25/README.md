...and I once again missed the leaderboard by just a few
places. Lost track of time and started 10 minutes late, or I
would have almost surely made it. Ah well.

stopped after 10 correct cycles (20 outputs) and guessed I
was done. Solving this problem properly is
[harder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).

Merry Christmas, everyone!
