# Advent of Code 2016: Day 24

This problem is amenable to straight Dijkstra search. I
spent more time than I should have messing with it and
placed just below 100 on the leaderboard on both parts,
which is disappointing since it was probably my last chance
to get on the leaderboard.

There are A\* things that could be done here, but at 0.33s
for part 1 and 0.65s for part 2 it hardly seems worth the
considerable hassle.
