# Advent of Code 2016: Day 7
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

Finally starting to successfully string-bash.  More fun with
Rust HashSets in part 2. Used function pointers to implement
the two parts.

Seems like an inordinate amount of code for such a simple
problem.

## Usage

* Part 1:

        cargo run 1 <input.txt

* Part 2:

        cargo run 2 <input.txt
