# Day 17: Part Two

You're curious how robust this security solution really is, and so you
decide to find longer and longer paths which still provide access to the
vault. You remember that paths always end the first time they reach the
bottom-right room (that is, they can never pass through it, only end in
it).

For example:

-   If your passcode were `ihgpwlah`, the longest path would take
    `370` steps.
-   With `kglvqrro`, the longest path would be `492` steps long.
-   With `ulqzkmiv`, the longest path would be `830` steps long.

What is the *length of the longest path* that reaches the vault?

Your puzzle answer was `448`.
