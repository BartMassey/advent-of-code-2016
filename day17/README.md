# Advent of Code 2016: Day 17

Huh. Once again it looks like I prematurely optimized. This
problem looked like it wanted Depth-First Iterative
Deepening, so that's what I implemented. Part 2, though,
made it clear that just doing a complete search would be
plenty fast. Oh well. Instantaneous answer for part 1, 10ms
for part 2.

## Usage

Part 1:

        cargo run --release 1 qzthpkfp

Part 2:

        cargo run --release 2 qzthpkfp
