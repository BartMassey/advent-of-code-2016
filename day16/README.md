# Advent of Code 2016: Day 16
Copyright (c) 2016 Bart Massey

I was surprised by how straightforward this problem was in
Rust. I used `String` for the data type rather than doing
something efficient. Ran instantly on part 1 and in 0.6s on
part 2.

## Usage

Part 1:

        cargo run 272 11011110011011101

Part 2:

        cargo run --release 35651584 11011110011011101
